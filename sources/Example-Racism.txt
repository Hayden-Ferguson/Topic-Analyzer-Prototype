Title: New Report Warns of “Entrenched Racial Inequities” Across U.S. Institutions

Washington, D.C.—A sweeping new report from the National Commission on Equity and Justice warns that racial disparities in the United States remain “deeply entrenched” across multiple sectors, despite decades of reform efforts and public commitments from both private industry and government leaders.

The 200-page analysis, based on two years of research and national survey data, found persistent gaps in income, health outcomes, housing access, and criminal justice treatment between white Americans and communities of color. In some areas, such as wealth accumulation and homeownership, disparities have widened over the past decade.

“Racism in America is not just about individual prejudice—it is embedded in the very systems that shape opportunity,” said Dr. Angela Kim, lead author of the report. “Our findings show that structural inequities continue to reproduce disadvantage from one generation to the next.”

Among the report’s most striking findings:

    Wealth and Housing: The median net worth of white households remains more than six times higher than that of Black households, a gap largely tied to differences in homeownership rates and property values. Discriminatory lending practices, while less overt than in the past, persist in mortgage approval data.

    Education: Schools serving predominantly Black and Latino students receive, on average, $2,200 less per pupil in annual funding than those serving majority-white populations, contributing to lower graduation rates and limited access to advanced coursework.

    Criminal Justice: Black Americans are nearly three times more likely to be arrested for the same offenses as white Americans, and sentencing disparities remain significant even after controlling for prior records and case details.

The release of the report comes at a politically charged moment. Civil rights advocates are pushing for stronger federal action, including legislation to expand voting protections, reform policing, and enforce fair housing laws. However, partisan divisions have stalled many of these proposals in Congress.

In some states, recent legislative efforts have focused instead on limiting how issues of race and racism can be taught in schools—a trend critics say undermines the ability to address systemic inequities. “You cannot fix what you refuse to acknowledge,” said Rep. Lisa Mendoza (D-CA), a member of the House Judiciary Committee.

Community leaders stress that progress is possible but requires sustained commitment. “It’s not enough to issue statements or form diversity committees,” said Jamal Brooks, director of the grassroots coalition One America Forward. “We need concrete policy changes, accountability for discriminatory practices, and investment in communities that have been excluded from opportunity for generations.”

The report concludes with a warning: without targeted interventions, current racial disparities could become even more entrenched as wealth and opportunity concentrate among a smaller, disproportionately white segment of the population.

“The question,” Dr. Kim said, “is not whether we can afford to address racism—it’s whether we can afford the cost of leaving it in place.”
