Title: Wealth Gap Widens as Wages Stagnate and Housing Costs Surge, Report Finds

A new analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Socioeconomic Research has found that the United States’ wealth gap has reached its widest point in decades, driven by surging asset values for the richest households and stagnant wages for much of the workforce.

The study, which examined federal tax records and consumer price data from 2010 to 2024, found that the top 1% of households now control 32% of the nation’s wealth—up from 27% a decade ago. Meanwhile, the bottom half of Americans collectively hold just 2%, down from 3% in 2010.

“These numbers are not just abstract statistics—they reflect a deepening divide in opportunity, mobility, and quality of life,” said Dr. Michael Sanderson, lead author of the report. “The ability to build wealth is increasingly concentrated in a small segment of the population, while millions struggle to meet basic needs.”

The report points to multiple drivers of the trend. Rising housing costs, which have outpaced wage growth in most metropolitan areas, have locked many younger Americans out of homeownership—a primary vehicle for wealth accumulation. At the same time, the stock market’s record highs have disproportionately benefited wealthier households, who are far more likely to own substantial investments.

“Wages in many sectors have been essentially flat, once you adjust for inflation,” Sanderson said. “But asset prices—stocks, real estate—have grown dramatically. If you don’t already own those assets, you’re falling behind.”

Policymakers are divided on solutions. Progressive lawmakers have renewed calls for higher taxes on capital gains and large inheritances, alongside expanded access to affordable housing. Conservative lawmakers, however, argue that economic growth and job creation should remain the priority, warning that overregulation and higher taxes could harm investment.

The human impact of the widening gap is visible in communities across the country. In Los Angeles, median rent has climbed nearly 40% over the past five years, forcing many residents into smaller units or shared housing. In the Midwest, towns that once thrived on manufacturing now face higher rates of food insecurity, even among full-time workers.

“This isn’t just about economics—it’s about social stability,” said Angela Ruiz, director of the nonprofit Equity Forward. “When large segments of the population feel like the system is stacked against them, trust erodes. And rebuilding that trust is far harder than closing the wealth gap itself.”

The report’s authors warn that if current trends continue, the next decade could see further entrenchment of wealth inequality, with consequences for economic growth, political cohesion, and public health.
